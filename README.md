👋 Hi, I’m Grace. I am a second year computer science student at the University of Sydney.
🌱 I’m currently learning basic web development (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`) through the Odin Project.
📔 Also have experience with `R`, `Python` and `Java`
💞️ I’m hoping to begin making contributions to the open-source community on through GitHub in 2023. For now though I am just using it to manage projects.
📫 Reach me on Discord `g09f16#2013` or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gracefry)
